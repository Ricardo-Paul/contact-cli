-- commander package gives us the ** command() method
** as arguments command() takes a function along wiht its parameters
** parameters are inside double quotes but are not strings
We can start using Commander in our application by simply requiring it and calling the parse() method at the end of our script and passing in the process arguments.

** it takes an alias for the function name (which is the command)
** describes the command

.description('Add a contact')
** process the arguments in .action

.action((firstname, lastname) =>{
    addContat({firstname, lastname});
} )

const program = require('commander')
program
    .command('addContat <firstname> <lastname>')
    .alias('a)
    .description('Add a contact')
    .action((firstname, lastname) => {
        addContat({firstname, lastname});
    } )
